Knuth-Morris-Pratt-KMP-Algorithm (String Matching):-

Knuth Morris Pratt (KMP) is an algorithm, which checks the characters from left to right.
When a pattern has a sub-pattern appears more than one in the sub-pattern, it uses that 
property to improve the time complexity, also for in the worst case. The time complexity 
of KMP is O(n)
